# Workout App Machine Learning Explorations

## Introduction

I developed a web application for tracking my workout progress, in addition to being able to track
what I was doing when, I put together a quick machine learning model to make a recommendation
for when I should increase the weight for a given exercise and by how much.

This repo is a series of experiments where I am trying to apply different machine learning techniques
to the recommendations. This is an on going projects. I will be periodically adding to it
and trying new and different things.
